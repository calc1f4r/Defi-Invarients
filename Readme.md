# DeFi Invariants

This repository contains invariants for DeFi protocols. These invariants are designed to verify the correctness of smart contracts and ensure they behave as expected under various conditions covering varuous edge cases and scenarios.

## Overview

The invariants in this repository serve as formal specifications,fuzzful fuzzing that can be used to:

- **Verify Smart Contract Correctness**: Ensure that DeFi protocols maintain their essential properties
- **Formal Verification**: Implement mathematical proofs to guarantee contract behavior
- **Security Auditing**: Identify potential vulnerabilities and edge cases
- **Protocol Testing**: Validate contract behavior during development and upgrades

## Repository Structure

- `ERC20-Token/`: Contains invariants specific to ERC20 token implementations
- Additional protocol-specific directories will be added as the repository grows

## Usage

These invariants can be integrated into your formal verification workflow and fuzzing to mathematically prove the correctness of your smart contracts. They serve as specifications that your contracts should satisfy under all possible execution paths.

## Contributing

Contributions are indeed welcome! We encourage developers, researchers, and security experts to:

- Add new invariants for additional DeFi protocols
- Improve existing invariant specifications
- Report issues or suggest enhancements
- Share feedback on invariant effectiveness

Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to help make this repository a comprehensive resource for DeFi protocol verification.
